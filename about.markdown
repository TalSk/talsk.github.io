In the past decade, I turned my hacking hobby into a career. My interests and experience include (but are not limited to) reverse engineering, malware analysis, embedded security, web hacking, cryptography, and computational complexity. I also teach a biannual workshop on assembly, reverse engineering x86/x64, and black box research.

I hold an M.Sc. in Theoretical Computer Science from the Weizmann Institute and have presented my thesis at the [14th ITCS conference at MIT, Cambridge](http://itcs-conf.org/itcs23/itcs23-accepted.html).

Currently, I'm the research team lead at Astrix Security, where, among other things, I research vulnerabilities in how cloud providers implement connectivity between (and by) non-human identities.

Some things I did in the past (but haven't yet had the time to write about):

* I hacked vehicle infotainment systems at my previous job
* I was a part of the "Unknown6" research group that broke [PokemonGo's anti-cheating system](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/08/anti-cheat-technology-stopped-pokemon-go-hackers-for-four-days/) in 2016.
* I turned a OnePlus 5T whose screen I accidentally broke into an [ad blocker](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) for my home network, as well as a [meta search engine](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) focused on ultimate privacy.
* I [presented my research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAZvIEIjGYU) at DEFCON31 on the [Ghost Token vulnerability](https://astrix.security/ghosttoken-exploiting-gcp-application-infrastructure-to-create-invisible-unremovable-trojan-app-on-google-accounts/) we found at Astrix during 2022.
* I conducted an open-heart surgery on my (1 month off warranty at the time) Nintendo Switch to replace its fan, which highlights the importance of the ["Right to Repair" movement](https://www.repair.org/stand-up/).
